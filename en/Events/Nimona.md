## Nimona Screening (3rd & 5th February 2025)

Falak hosted a special screening of Nimona, a bold and heartwarming story about embracing individuality, resilience and the power of being unapologetically yourself. Through the journey of a shape-shifting anti-hero who challenges norms and redefines heroism, attendees were able to engage in a story that celebrates self-acceptance and challenging expectations. 

The event inspired conversations about identity, difference and the power of standing out.
