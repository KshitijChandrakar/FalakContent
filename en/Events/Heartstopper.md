## Heartstopper Screening (24th January 2024)

Falak hosted a heartwarming screening of Heartstopper, creating a fun and inclusive space to celebrate queer joy, self-discovery, and friendship. Through Nick and Charlieâ€™s story, attendees laughed, connected, and embraced the importance of representation. 

The event was a beautiful reminder that love, in all its forms, deserves to be celebrated. ðŸŒˆâœ¨
