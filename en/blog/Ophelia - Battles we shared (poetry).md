We fought together, you and I,
Both against the darkness
and against the light.
We fought injustices perceived
though not agreed on.
We fought together, you and I,
One against the other
All through the night.

We fought together, you and I,
being young and strong
and always so, so wise.
We fought when we agreed,
but mostly when we disagreed
on little things you and I
could not comprehend. We fought
with truth, though oftener with lies.

We each hated the other, you and I,
being certain of each other's
wrongs and foul deceit.
There were screams and deaths
and more hardships than we could
endure - yet we endured them, you and I,
young men, strong men;
we would not contemplate defeat

In this, our holy war. You and I
fought greatly in those
dark, forgotten days,
heroes each to our side.
Bright was our glory,
brighter still the death you and I
brought. Heroes we may have been,
my dear, in that autumn haze,

But I remember what you and I
did - one more sin committed -
away from prying eyes.
We hated, each the other,
for more reasons that I can name,
but nonetheless you and I
broke vows we had sworn for a taste
of sweet, stifled cries.

We loved together, you and I,
one single night when no one
thought to be with us here,
and spent the rest of our days
in melancholy hatred. My dear,
in these forgotten halls you and I
fight still. We are still here -
lost, in this benighted atmosphere.
