title: "Redefining Manhood: Breaking Toxic Gender Roles"
---

"Why don't you serve the guests?" "Can you bring them snacks from the kitchen?", "Help me
clean the drawer quickly" are questions I have heard being asked exclusively to my sister
growing up.

She's only three years older than me, so it's certainly not because she’s better at these things than
I am.

I think the presence of ingrained patriarchy in almost every Indian household is so normalised
that it can be hard to recognise its existence. Perhaps it is because of generations of conditioning
that both men and women propagate such a mindset.

It promotes the idea that a certain gender is responsible for certain tasks and creates toxic gender
roles.

Although I know my family holds relatively progressive views and would never knowingly
discriminate based on gender, this same mindset, when reinforced, leads some men to feel a
sense of entitlement. The same sense of entitlement that makes them believe they have the right
to take liberties with women.

It is important for men to engage in conversations about equality and feminism so that we can
create an inclusive society for all genders. The patriarchal mindset affects both men and women,
and overcoming it requires everyone's contribution. This could be done by introducing gender
studies as a subject in school, by creating equal opportunities and responsibilities at home, and
by creating a safe space for open communication.

I am ashamed to share some of my stereotypically feminine interests, which has made me
hesitant to express myself freely, even in my own home. When I once asked my father to buy me
an embroidery kit, he laughed because he could not understand why a man would want to learn
such a thing.

I think if we truly want to achieve gender equality, we need to challenge the deeply rooted
patriarchal norms in our society. It's not enough to simply acknowledge their existence, we must
actively work to overcome them. This means challenging our own beliefs and behaviours, as
well as those of our family and community.

I have come to realise that it’s in my hands to redefine what it means to be a man in an Indian
household. I am the one who has to take the initiative to serve the guests or help clean.
