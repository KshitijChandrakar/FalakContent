## About Us

Founded in 2023, Falak is an official student-run society under the School of Liberal Studies (SOLS) at UPES, Dehradun.

We are dedicated to promoting inclusivity and creating safe spaces where every individual feels valued, respected and empowered to express their authentic selves.

Through a variety of initiatives focused on advocacy, education and community building, Falak aims to inspire meaningful conversations and challenge societal norms. Our work is based on the belief that diversity enriches us all, and we aim to create an environment where everyone can thrive. 

Falak envisions a future where individuality is celebrated and the campus is a safe place for all.
